<!---Quickstart updates for the closed beta by @nrichers in [#141](https://github.com/validmind/documentation/pull/141)--->
- **Quickstart updates for the closed beta**. We updated the Quickstart section of our documentation to reflect recent UI and sign-up flow changes. [Read more ...](../../guide/quickstart.qmd)


<!---[SC-2411] Clustering models support by @AnilSorathiya in [#271](https://github.com/validmind/developer-framework/pull/271)--->
- **[SC-2411] Clustering models support**. This PR add support to clustering models in the framework. The PR covers the following:
* A quickstart demo notebook for a simple clustering model. 
* A standard digits dataset has been used to create a demo.
* New metrics have been added  to the developer framework to have decent support for clustering models.


<!---John6797/sc 2416/embeddings models support by @johnwalz97 in [#272](https://github.com/validmind/developer-framework/pull/272)--->
- **John6797/sc 2416/embeddings models support**. This PR adds initial support for text embeddings models in the developer framework. Specifically, we are adding a new notebook that demonstrates creating, using and testing a BERT embeddings model using the hugging face library.

Changes:
* adds new folder in model_validation tests for embeddings... adds initial versions of new tests for text embedding models
* adds support for `feature_extraction` tasks in the hugging face model wrapper in the dev framework so that we can extract embeddings from a hugging face model
* add new notebook for demonstrating the above
* updates dependencies


<!---[SC-2346] Rouge and Bert score metrics should show average scores by @juanmleng in [#263](https://github.com/validmind/developer-framework/pull/263)--->
- **[SC-2346] Rouge and Bert score metrics should show average scores**. - Added `RougeMetricsAggregate` and `BertScoreAggregate` to provide a higher-level overview of model performance for high number of text rows. These metrics complement the detailed row-by-row analysis cover by `RougeMetrics` and `BertScore`.
- Tested these metrics running `foundational_models_summarization_high_code.ipynb`

<!---Feature: Remove block from documentation by @gtagle in [#467](https://github.com/validmind/frontend/pull/467)--->
- **Feature: Remove block from documentation**. This PR introduces the ability to remove text blocks and test-driven blocks from documentation projects.

To access this functionality to you have to first select the block you'd like to remove and select the garbage can either in the text-block's toolbar or the test-driven's block single-button toolbar.
