These steps show you how you can create a new documentation project in the ValidMind platform. You can use this new project to upload tests and documentation to the ValidMind platform, review and validate models, and generate validation reports. 

## Prerequisites

* You are registered user on the ValidMind platform
* The model you are documenting is registered in the model inventory (see **Register a Model in the Inventory**)

## Steps

1. Log in to the ValidMind platform
   
2. In the "Documentation Projects" page, click on "Create new project"
   
3. Select the relevant details in the "Create new project" form
   - Select the relevant Model 
   - Select the relevant type of documentation you are looking to generate 
   - Enter a name for the project 
   - Click on "Create Project"

ValidMind has now created an empty documentation project associated with the model, which can be accessed from the UI by the Documentation Projects page or by navigating to the relevant model details page in the Model Inventory.
   
*Note: the documentation template will be automatically applied based on the selected model details and documentation requirements configured by the Administrators (e.g. Model Risk Management team).*

4. Finding project identifier, API key and secret 
   - In the "Client Integration" page of the newly created project, you can now find the initialization code that allows the client library to associate documentation and tests with the appropriate project. The initialization code configures the following arguments: 

* api_host: Location of the ValidMind API.
* api_key: Account API key.
* api_secret: Account Secret key.
* project: The project identifier. The `project` argument is mandatory since it allows the library to associate all data collected with a specific account project.

The code snippet can be copied and pasted directly into your developer source code to initialize the ValidMind Developer Framework. 

## Troubleshooting

[Include any common issues or errors that may arise during the task and how to resolve them.]

## What's Next

Use the ValidMind Developer Framework to document a model built in Python. **For more details and examples, you can refer to our ValidMind Python Library introduction**
