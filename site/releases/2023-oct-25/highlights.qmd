## Release highlights

This release introduces support for a number of new models in the ValidMind Developer Framework, along with a new feature in the Platform UI that enables you to remove blocks of text or test-related content from documentation projects. 

### ValidMind Developer Framework (v1.22.0)

<!--- NR the next three notebooks have been commented out as they are not ready to be released.--->
<!---[SC-2284] Support regression models by @AnilSorathiya in [#259](https://github.com/validmind/developer-framework/pull/259)
#### Support for regression models

The ValidMind Developer Framework has added support for regression models. The updates include:

- A new demo notebook featuring a simple regression model
- Utilization of the standard California housing tabular dataset for the demo
- Addition of new metrics, `Errors` and `R-squared`, to support regression model evaluation
- Use of existing tabular dataset metrics for data validation

<!---[SC-2411] Clustering models support by @AnilSorathiya in [#271](https://github.com/validmind/developer-framework/pull/271)
#### Support for clustering models

The ValidMind Developer Framework has added support for clustering models. The updates include:

- A new demo notebook for a simple clustering model 
- Utilization of a standard digits dataset for the demo
- Addition of new metrics to support clustering model evaluation

<!---John6797/sc 2416/embeddings models support by @johnwalz97 in [#272](https://github.com/validmind/developer-framework/pull/272)
#### Support for embeddings models

We added initial support for text embeddings models in the ValidMind Developer Framework which enables you to create, use and test a BERT embeddings model utilizing the Hugging Face library. The updates include:

- A new demo notebook
- A new folder in `model_validation` tests for embeddings, along with initial versions of tests for text embedding models
- Support for `feature_extraction` tasks in the Hugging Face model wrapper of the ValidMind Developer Framework
- Updated software dependencies

<!---[SC-2236] Demo notebook for changing config/parameters by @AnilSorathiya in [#251](https://github.com/validmind/developer-framework/pull/251)--->
#### New notebook to demonstrate how to change configuration parameters

This notebook serves as a guide for modifying configuration and parameters within the ValidMind Developer Framework. It includes the following features:

- A preview template allowing users to select a sample test for configuration
- Instructions on how to pass custom configurations to `run_documentation_tests()`
- An option to run documentation tests focused on a specific section, avoiding the need to run the entire template

[Try it ...](../../notebooks/how_to/configure_parameters_demo.ipynb)

### ValidMind Platform UI (v1.8.0)

<!---Feature: Remove block from documentation by @gtagle in [#467](https://github.com/validmind/frontend/pull/467)--->
#### Remove blocks from documentation

You can now remove blocks of text or test-related content from documentation projects in the editor of the Platform UI. This new feature gives you more control over your documentation projects and enables you to remove content that is no longer needed for a specific project, for example.

To remove text blocks and test-driven blocks from documentation projects, you first select the block you want to remove and click {{< fa trash-can >}}, either in the text-block's toolbar or in the test-driven's block single-button toolbar.

You then get a confirmation to remove the block:

![](../../guide/remove-test-driven-block.gif){width=50%}

After confirmation, the block is removed from the documentation project.

<!--- NR I don't think we have any user-facing docs for this feature ...

<!---feat: Add settings landing page by @wkm97 in [#466](https://github.com/validmind/frontend/pull/466)
- **Added Settings landing page**. - New settings landing page to organize settings.
