Learn how to run our introductory Jupyter notebook with the ValidMind Colab image.

## Prerequisites

You must have access to [Google Colaboratory (Colab)](https://colab.research.google.com/). 

Google Colaboratory (Colab) is a free Jupyter notebook environment that runs in the cloud. You can work with, run, and download our sample Jupyter notebooks from there.

## Steps

1. Open the Quickstart notebook in Google Colaboratory: [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1NLtjCFUZV2I_ttGUkiAL9uwGZK_SGUlw?usp=share_link)

2. Click **File** > **Save a copy in Drive** to make a copy of the Quickstart notebook so that you can modify it later.

Alternatively, you can download the notebook source and work with it in your own developer environment.

## About our Jupyter notebooks
**Notebooks from ValidMind are safe to run** — If you get a warning that this notebook was not authored by Google, we welcome you to inspect the notebook source to make sure.

**Runtime errors** — We recommend that you not use the *Run all* option. Run each cell individually to see what is happening in the notebook. If you do see errors, re-run the notebook cells.
