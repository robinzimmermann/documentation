Learn how to resolve commonly encountered issues with the Developer Framework.

## Cannot install ValidMind

You may encounter an error message when running `pip install validmind` or `import validmind as vm` in the ValidMind Developer Framework notebooks.

Make sure you are installing the latest version of the Developer Framework by running this command:

`%pip install --upgrade validmind`

## Cannot initialize ValidMind client library

If you encounter an error message when running `vm.init()`, it may be because you are not using the correct initialization code for the project you are trying to connect to. 

Follow the steps in [Install and initialize the Developer Framework](install-and-initialize-developer-framework.qmd) for detailed instructions on how to integrate the Developer Framework and upload to the ValidMind Platform.
