Whether you're new to ValidMind or an experienced user, our guides provide how-to instructions for tasks that you perform in the [Platform UI](https://app.prod.validmind.ai/). 

To make it easier to find the right guide, we've grouped the most common tasks for you:

- [Onboarding](#onboarding)
- [Model documentation](#model-documentation)
- [Model validation](#model-validation)

<!--- The link to the developer section is in here twice, once as a callout and once as a listing tile in the model developer section. --->
::: {.callout-tip}
This section primarily covers tasks you perform in the Platform UI. To get started with documenting models in your own development environment, refer to the [Developer Framework](get-started-developer-framework.qmd) section.
