<!---[SC-2303] Shap metric is returning an error by @juanmleng in [#262](https://github.com/validmind/developer-framework/pull/262)--->
- **[SC-2303] Shap metric is returning an error**. - Pinned `matplotlib` to version `3.7.x` in `pyproject.toml`, to address an incompatibility issue between the latest `matplotlib` version (`3.8.0`) and the current setup, which was causing visualization errors in SHAP plots.

- Monitor the releases of `matplotlib` for potential fixes in the future. Once the underlying issue is addressed, we should consider updating to a newer version.
