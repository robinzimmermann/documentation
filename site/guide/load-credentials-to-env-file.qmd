Learn how to store project identifier credentials in a .env file instead of using inline credentials. This topic is relevant for model developers who want to follow best practices for security when running notebooks.


## Prerequisites

* You are a registered user on the ValidMind Platform
* The model is already [registered in the model inventory](register-models.qmd)
* You have already located the project identifier, API key and secret
* You are logged into the ValidMind Platform

## Steps

1. Locate the project identifier credentials for your documentation project. This can be found on the **Getting Started** page. Copy the code snippet and insert it under the section **Initialize the client library** in the notebook.

2. Insert this code snippet above where you have just insterted your project identifier credentials:

```
%load_ext dotenv
%dotenv dev.env
```

3. Run the cell. Instead of using inline credentials, this cell will now load your project credentials to a .env file.

## Why is this recommended?

Storing credentials in a .env file is considered a best practice for security. Embedding credentials directly within the code makes them more susceptible to accidental exposure when sharing code or collaborating on projects. Keeing project credentials in a separate file also allows for precise access control and ensures that sensitive credentials are not publically accessible.
